# Titanic_SoftwareMethods
Push my Titanic Project to Github

Over the past few weeks, we did two things:

We build a Titanic survival model, and submitted the model to Kaggle for evaluation.
We learned how to use Git to track versions of our projects, and to mirror projects on Github.com
Now we'll combine these is a simple way. For this assignment, I simply want you to do the following:

Initialize git tracking in your Titanic project directory, add all files, and do an initial commit.
Create a README.md file describing your project, the type of model(s) you used, and the validation scores for your models.
Add and commit your README.md file.
Create a repository (also called a "repo") on Github.com for your Titanic project.
Set your remote for this project to point at your Github repo,
Push your Titanic project up to Github, and verify that the push was successful (can you see your project on Github?)
Send me the link to your Github Titanic repo using the Assignment Submission button below.



The types of models I tried:
	Decision Tree Model
	Random Forest Model
	K-nearest Neighbor Model

Validation results for my models:
For the decision tree model, the accuracy rate is 77.15%
For the random forest model, the accuracy rate is 78.28%
For the KNN model, the accuracy rate is 68.16%

Statement:
When using the titanic.csv data set, three different models were tried to process the project, the Titanic survival prediction. Among them, the effect of the random forest model is the best, with an accuracy rate of 79.78%.
In addition, when I used the train.csv and test.csv data provided by Kaggle, I tried to create a decision tree model separately after cleaning the data, and achieved an accuracy rate of more than 82.7%. The model has also ran out of an accuracy rate of more than 84% during testing, which is exciting.
