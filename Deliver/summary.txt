The types of models I tried:
	Decision Tree Model
	Random Forest Model
	K-nearest Neighbor Model

Validation results for my models:
For the decision tree model, the accuracy rate is 77.15%
For the random forest model, the accuracy rate is 78.28%
For the KNN model, the accuracy rate is 68.16%

Statement:
When using the titanic.csv data set, three different models were tried to process the project, the Titanic survival prediction. Among them, the effect of the random forest model is the best, with an accuracy rate of 79.78%.
In addition, when I used the train.csv and test.csv data provided by Kaggle, I tried to create a decision tree model separately after cleaning the data, and achieved an accuracy rate of more than 82.7%. The model has also ran out of an accuracy rate of more than 84% during testing, which is exciting.
